#### Box model
Machine downtime is a significant concern for the corrugated box manufacturing industry, leading to an annual opportunity loss exceeding $2.7 million. One of the primary contributors to this downtime is the strength testing process for corrugated boxes. During this process, production must halt to await results from the Quality Assurance Laboratory. If the results meet the strength specifications for each SKU, production can resume seamlessly. However, if the results do not meet the required standards, machine operators must rely on their experience to adjust parameters and achieve the desired quality, further delaying production.

To remedy these losses and enhance efficiency, we propose the implementation of a predictive model designed to estimate the strength of corrugated boxes in real-time by utilizing a combination of raw materials specification and machine parameters data. This model would eliminate the need to stop machines for testing, thereby reducing downtime and waiting periods for lab results. Furthermore, the predictive model can offer recommendations for optimal machine settings, empowering staff to make data-driven adjustments. This approach not only boosts productivity but also addresses real-world challenges, ensuring a smoother and more cost-effective manufacturing process.
